                <p className="w-2/3 flex justify-center items-center text-amber-50 text-lg rounded" >When we finally decided to take the step to redesign, tweak and take an old school approach to building these classic styled guitars and basses, of course we chose the best possible materials and made sure the accuracy of the cutting and shaping process is of the highest quality. The best instruments ever produced have been finished with real nitro-cellulose lacquer and that’s what we use on our highest build level instruments. It takes longer to finish but the tone achieved and the progressive quality of sound over the years of ownership is worth every step and the build expense we incur in the production schedule.

                <p className="w-2/3 flex justify-center items-center text-amber-50 text-lg rounded">The base line of Vibrawood Custom Instruments, come together as an alternative to a vintage Fender instrument from the 50’s, 60’s or 70’s – the undeniable BEST era in Fender history. The original vintage Fenders from that era now are worth anywhere from $7,000. To 25,000. and the thought of risking loss or damage to them on stage or in the studio is insurmountable. We have created instruments in their image that play great, sound amazing and look incredibly beautiful. These Custom Shop instruments start at just $1650. and are replaceable in the event of a catastrophic loss.
