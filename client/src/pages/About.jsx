                    Welcome to the VibraWood classic series of hand built Custom Shop instruments, distributed exclusively at Guitar Villa – Bethlehem PA.
                    Over the course of many years, we grew famous for our expert set-up and modification work and became the go-to custom shop where many working musicians trusted us to improve their existing instruments.  Whether it was electronic modifications or repairs, set-up neck and bridge work, fret leveling and replacement or just plain adjustments to optimum playability, we did the job!

                <p className="w-fit flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-500 p-5">We noticed that very large guitar manufacturing companies didn't seem to be able to take the time or justify the expense to use the best quality select materials on their instruments.  This was a major concern to our customers and a much needed niche market we decided to fill. After many years of prototyping and experiments with tone woods and electronics, our owner took the bull by the horns and started the VibraWood instrument line of classically inspired guitars and basses.

                <p className="w-fit flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-500 p-5">When we finally decided to take the step to redesign, tweak and take an old school approach to building these classic styled guitars and basses, of course we chose the best possible materials and made sure the accuracy of the cutting and shaping process is of the highest quality. The best instruments ever produced have been finished with real nitro-cellulose lacquer and that’s what we use on our highest build level instruments. It takes longer to finish but the tone achieved and the progressive quality of sound over the years of ownership is worth every step and the build expense we incur in the production schedule.

                <p className="w-fit flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-500 p-5">The base line of Vibrawood Custom Instruments, come together as an alternative to a vintage Fender instrument from the 50’s, 60’s or 70’s – the undeniable BEST era in Fender history. The original vintage Fenders from that era now are worth anywhere from $7,000. To 25,000. and the thought of risking loss or damage to them on stage or in the studio is insurmountable. We have created instruments in their image that play great, sound amazing and look incredibly beautiful. These Custom Shop instruments start at just $1650. and are replaceable in the event of a catastrophic loss.

                <p className="w-fit flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-500 p-5">We love all species of wood and take pride in selecting the best type for any custom build result we are working toward. The quality starts with every tree, plank or board we select, purchase and process. We have procured amazing trees bearing beautiful and resonant hardwoods and the tone achieved is both attractive to the eyes as well as the ears after we make them into custom instruments.

                <p className="w-fit flex justify-center items-center bg-gray-500 p-5">The VibraWood Custom line of instruments sources the best wood, pickups, hardware and electronics to complete a true (one off) custom build for our customers.  We are open to use any and all pickups and electronics for each customer’s dream build. These instruments resonate in a big way and are loud acoustically, before ever plugging them in. We believe that's the way to tell the difference between a multi-laminate cutting board and a real resonant instrument! Each and every completed custom instrument build has a voice and character of it’s own. Because of the tone wood selection process we engage in, these instruments are both light weight and highly resonant. The real surprise to this high quality line of Custom Shop instruments is the affordability.
